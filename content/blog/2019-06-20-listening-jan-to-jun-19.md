Some of the records I have really appreeciated in "H1" 2019 are here. There's a [Buy Music Club](https://buymusic.club/) list at the bottom to go buy the ones you like and support the artists behind them, too!

**Logic1000, LOGIC1000** *[SUMAC]* - Punchy and vibrant Aussie twists on UK funky rhythms, also featuring a slammin' [Niche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwO16Eg5NOc) rework.

**Shy One & Kwam, Spoons** *[Astral Black]* - An ode to life, London and Wetherspoons, recorded in ONE DAY. Raw, relatable lyrics and cold productions.

**Budgie, Holy Ghost Zone** *[Self-released]* - More effortless Gospel bounce according to Budgie. That's 685 – 689 Old Kent Road on the cover!

**Powder, Powder In Space** *[Beats in Space]* - Powder goes into space and brings back only the freshest house, for your enjoyment.

**Sikka Rymes, Love Di People** *[DUPPY GUN]* - Completely wild and essential performance from Sikka, perfectly complemented by bonkers Genesis Hull beats.

**Solange, When I Get Home** *[Columbia]* - Playful, spiritual jazz and Houston sounds form a stunning patchwork to get fully lost in. 

**Dave, Psychodrama** *[Neighbourhood]* - Powerful and difficult listening at times, but allways important and gravitational raps from Streatham's finest.

**Anz, Invitation 2 Dance** *[2 B Real]* - The first of two heavy hitters from Manchester on here. "Play these ones loud."

**Belter, Off The Meds** *[Studio Barnhus]* - Hypnotic and intoxicating full debut from the Swedish-South African crew, does what it says on the tin. Joy kicks on from [81b](https://tossportal.bandcamp.com/album/81b) with party-mode remix business. 

**Bézier, 府城** *[Honey Soundsystem]* - Tracks you can't label, the result of a deeply moving and emotional recording process. 

**India Jordan, DNT STP MY LV** *[LOCAL ACTION]* - More Manc royalty! Title track is the percy, will turn any frown upside down + activate hips without warning.

**Various, PDA Compilation Volume 1** *[PDA]* - 100% club heat from PDA friends + fam. All profits go to the Association of Queer Ethnic Minorities (A.Q.E.M), too.

**Afrikan Sciences, & The Kick Drum is Default** *[Deepblak]* - Eric rewiring your little brain, as ever. 

**Tujiko Noriko, Kuro (OST)** *[ENTOPIA]* - Tense, atmospheric soundscapes on *PANs* new soundtrack offshoot. 
**Gila, Trench Tones** *[Self-released]* - Runs through hip-hop, techno and ambient wonder. Had to cop the wax for that [Eric Hu](www.erichu.info) artwork!

**Tierra Whack, All the singles** *[Self-released]* - The Dr Seuss type spitter paints fully-formed tracks this year with as much colour as 2018's *Whack World* vignettes. I stan.
