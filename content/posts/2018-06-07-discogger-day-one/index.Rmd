I've been working on a new R package. [**`discogger`**](https://github.com/ewenme/discogger) is an open-source effort, at an experimental stage of development, providing straightforward tools to help out with Discogs' [API v2.0](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#). [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com) is a crowd-sourced music database and marketplace, a proper treasure trove for record diggers and music lovers to learn more about what they're jamming to. A better route into this data for R users should yield some nice results.

## discogger 101

First up, you'll need to register a Discogs application via [https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers). Doing so will grant you a "personal access token" (accessible at the same link above) which you can store as an environment variable (*DISCOGS_API_TOKEN*) using the `discogs_api_token()` function. All functions in the `discogger` package will automatically look for your token and prompt entry if it isn't found.

The `discogger` interface to Discogs data currently spans [Database](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:database) (releases, artists, labels) and [User Collection](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:user-collection) API requests, with a view to growing functionality in these spaces and eventually expanding into [Marketplace](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:marketplace) (inventory, orders). The next section will demo how these functions can be put in to use, and chained together for quietly impressive analyses.

## Diggin' in to Dance Mania

[Dance Mania](http://dancemaniarecords.com/) is about as iconic as it gets when it comes to Chicago House record labels (you hopefully got a flavour by clicking on the name...). `discogger` is well equipped to retrieve record label information, with `discogs_label()` first up.

```{r}
# load packages
library(discogger)
library(tidyverse)

# get DM label info
discogs_label(label_id = 314)
```

Hopefully you learnt something new from that output, but it's not particularly ready for any analysis. I'm quite interested in getting more detailed metadata around Dance Mania's 12" releases, which can be done with `discogs_label_releases()`.

```{r}
# get DM releases
dm_releases <- discogs_label_releases(label_id = 314)
  
# extract request content
dm_releases_df <- dm_releases$content %>%
  # return 12" releases only
  filter(grepl('12"', format))

dm_releases_df
```

The tidy tibble format returned is much better suited to analysis in R, but the content I'm after is not quite there. Turns out community metrics, such as the number of users who own or have marked a record as one they "want", are available from a records release page (not it's label release listing). `discogs_release()` can be used, in conjunction with `map()` (from the [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) package), to iterate through releases and collect this information.

```{r}
# get DM release info
dm_releases_info <- map(dm_releases_df$id, discogs_release)

# extract release content
dm_releases_content <- map(dm_releases_info, "content")
  
# extract fields relevant for community metrics analysis
dm_community_metrics <- tibble(
  title = map_chr(dm_releases_content, "title"),
  artist = map_chr(dm_releases_content, "artists_sort"),
  year = map_int(dm_releases_content, "year"),
  have = map_int(dm_releases_content, c("community", "have")),
  want = map_int(dm_releases_content, c("community", "want"))
  ) %>%
  # for each record...
  group_by(title, artist) %>%
  filter(
    # keep the one most users have...
    have == max(have),
    # ...and rm releases with missing release year
    year >= 1985
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

dm_community_metrics
```

With this output, a visualisation can be knocked up to explore which Dance Mania 12-inches Discogs users want or own.

```{r fig.height=7}
# load viz helpers
library(scico)
library(ewenthemes)
library(ggrepel)

# plot
ggplot(dm_community_metrics, aes(x=have, y=want)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=year)) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=paste0(artist, " - ", title)), size=3,
                  data = subset(dm_community_metrics, have >= 800 | want >= 1000),
                  family = "IBM Plex Sans") +
  labs(title="Dance Mania 12\"s on Discogs", 
       subtitle="How many Discogs user's own/want Dance Mania (1985 - 2018) 12-inches",
       x = "Own it", y = "Want it",
       caption="source: Discogs | made by @ewen_") +
  theme_ewen_rs(grid = FALSE, subtitle_size = 11, subtitle_margin = 20) +
  scico::scale_colour_scico(palette = "lajolla") +
  guides(col = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal", title = "Release year",
                               barheight = 0.5, barwidth = 10, title.vjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
