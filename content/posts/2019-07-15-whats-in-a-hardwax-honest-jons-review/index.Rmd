[Honest Jons](https://honestjons.com) of London and [Hardwax](https://hardwax.com/) of Berlin are undisputed record store royalty. Both are 30+ years in the game but maintain a fiercely independent and unapologetic representation of music in their city, and beyond. This rep extends to their on-line presence, most infamously through the unique style in which each store's staff break down the new stuff hitting the shelves. 

Here's something from Honest Jons, on a Salik and DJ Sotofett [outing on Wania](https://www.discogs.com/Salik-DJ-Sotofett-Inna-Brixton-Acid-Site-Mix/release/11213973):

> ‘A strictly-rockers intermingling of dubstep and d&b, with heavy bass and darkly atmospheric strings. DJ Sotofett falls out of line on the flip, heading off into acidic and 3D soundscapes.’

Let that one soak in. Then, try out Hardwax's take on Metrist's [Pollen Part I](https://www.discogs.com/Metrist-Pollen-Pt-I/release/13786196):

> 'Crisp IDM & Grime trained, Electro affine, modern UK Techno / Tech House adventures.'

Now, a little dig into the shop's record reviews at scale.[^fullcode] A "quantitative toast" to the best to ever do it `r emo::ji("wine_glass")`

## Scrapin' up the crates `r emo::ji("pick")`

I'm collating these (and hopefully others, soon come) record store's listings data[^scraping] over at [crates](https://github.com/ewenme/crates), a GitHub repo with data + code as u like. Here's a preview of Honest Jons' listings, to give u a flavour.

```{r get-honest-data}

# get honest jons data
honest_jons_recs <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewenme/crates/master/data/honest-jons/honest-jons-listings.csv") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(review)) %>% 
  distinct(artist, release, label, .keep_all = TRUE)

honest_jons_recs
```

Similar listings data are available in `crates` for Hardwax. Here's what's in there to work with (at time of writing).

```{r merge-data}

# get hardwax data
hardwax_recs <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewenme/crates/master/data/hardwax/hardwax-listings.csv") %>% 
  mutate(store = "Hardwax")

# bind store data
records <- bind_rows(mutate(honest_jons_recs, store = "Honest Jons"), 
                  select(hardwax_recs, artist:label, review, store)) %>% 
  # add ID field
  group_by(store) %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number())

# count reviews x store
ggplot(data = records, aes(x = store)) +
  geom_bar(fill = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7]) +
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label = comma(stat(count))), vjust = -1, size = 5) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 20000)) +
  theme_ewen_rs(plot_title_size = 18, subtitle_size = 12, base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Record store review counts",
       subtitle = "# of Hardwax and Honest Jons reviews of records present in the data.",
       x = NULL, y = NULL, caption = "@ewen_")
```

## Characterising store chat `r emo::ji("speech_balloon")`

Even if you're not familiar with Hardwax's or Honest Jons' review style, you may have noticed some immediate differences in the examples shared at the start of this post. Off the bat, Hardwax's reviews tend to be of the "short and sweet" variety.

```{r review-lengths}

# create word-level data
words <- records %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, review, token = "words") %>% 
  ungroup()

# summarise word counts
word_counts <- words %>% 
  group_by(store, id) %>% 
  summarise(word_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
# viz word count distro
ggplot(word_counts, aes(x = word_count, fill = store, colour = store)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_ghibli_d(name = "KikiMedium", direction = -1) +
  scale_colour_ghibli_d(name = "KikiMedium", direction = -1) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme_ewen_rs(plot_title_size = 18, subtitle_size = 12, base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "Hardwax reviews are notoriously short",
       subtitle = "The distribution of record review lengths (word counts) by store.",
       x = "Word count", y = "Density", caption = "@ewen_")

```

In actual fact, Hardwax reviews hover around the seven word mark, with [the longest hitting 38 words](https://hardwax.com/61214/patrick-pulsinger/impassive-skies/). Honest Jons, on the other hand, dish out 27 words on average, but vary considerably - they penned a whole 416 words about [Horace Tapscott With The Pan-Afrikan People's Arkestra](https://www.discogs.com/Horace-Tapscott-With-The-Pan-Afrikan-Peoples-Arkestra-Live-At-IUCC/master/256086). Here's a snippet:

> The pianist was an organiser, and instead of chasing a successful recording career, he wanted to build a community band that would act as “a cultural safe house for the music.” “I wanted to say, This is your music. This is black music, and I want to present a panorama of the whole thing right here.” “We would preserve the music on our ark, the mothership…”

It is worth pointing out that Hardwax review *every* record that hits the store, while Honest Jons are a bit more selective (less than half of the listings gleaned for this work had a review). 

Beyond review length, analysing the actual review content should help to describe makes reading listings on each site such a unique experience. For starters, examining which words are most common in each store's writing (after excluding common stop words e.g. "and").

```{r store-common}
# create word-level df
review_words <- dplyr::anti_join(words, stop_words)

# calc word count metrics
review_word_counts <- review_words %>%
  group_by(store) %>% 
  mutate(review_count = n_distinct(id)) %>% 
  group_by(store, word) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            count_per_review = round(count / unique(review_count), digits = 3)) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
# plot common words x store
review_word_counts %>% 
  group_by(store) %>% 
  top_n(10, count_per_review) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, count, store)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = count_per_review)) +
  geom_point2(size = 4, colour = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7]) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ store, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_reordered() +
  theme_ewen_rs(axis = FALSE, plot_title_size = 14, subtitle_size = 12, 
                base_size = 12, axis_title_just = "c") +
  labs(title = 'Hardwax say "techno" once every three reviews (roughly)',
       subtitle = "The most common words featured in reviews of records, by store.",
       x = NULL, y = "Words per review", caption = "@ewen_")
```

Yeah, Hardwax talk techno quite a bit. Interestingly, "classic" is the only word that features in the top ten across both shops.

A weighted log odds statistic[^lo] can be helpful to measure how the usage of words differs across groups (in this case, record stores), accounting for sampling variability. In short, which words are most representative of that store when compared to the other?

```{r store-specific}

# calc log odds
word_log_odds <- review_word_counts %>% 
  bind_log_odds(store, word, count)

# plot highest log odds x store
word_log_odds %>%
  group_by(store) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, log_odds_weighted)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, log_odds_weighted)) +
  geom_point2(size = 4, colour = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7]) +
  facet_wrap(~store, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_ewen_rs(axis = FALSE, plot_title_size = 18, subtitle_size = 12, 
                base_size = 12, axis_title_just = "c") +
  labs(title = "Record store-specific review words",
       subtitle = "The words featured in reviews of records that are most specific to that\nrecord store.",
       x = NULL, y = "Log odds ratio, weighted by uninformative Dirichlet prior", caption = "@ewen_") 
```

It's conclusive - techno is Hardwax and Hardwax is techno.

## Going deeper with HJ's `r emo::ji("mag")`

Sticking with Honest Jons' reviews for a bit - the most common and specific words have been explored above, but examining these concepts in tandem can help paint a better picture of what makes an HJ review.

```{r hj-specific-common}
word_log_odds %>% 
  filter(store == "Honest Jons") %>% 
  top_n(50, count_per_review) %>%
  ggplot(aes(count_per_review, log_odds_weighted)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, 
               color = "#222324", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = word), family = "Work Sans Light", size = 3, seed = 3) +
  geom_point2(colour = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7], size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_ewen_rs(axis = FALSE, grid = "XY", plot_title_size = 16, subtitle_size = 12, 
                base_size = 12) +
  labs(title = 'Honest Jons reviews include "jazz" and "music" a lot',
       subtitle = "The most frequently occurring and most characteristic words in Honest Jons\nrecord reviews. Top 50 most frequent-occurring words included.",
       x = "Words per review", y = "Weighted log odds ratio", caption = "@ewen_") 
```

"Music" features heavy in a record store reviews text, shock horror. It should be noted that some of the genre-based words placements in these graphics are skewed by an unequal no. of reviews by genre on the site.

Honest Jons lists records under one or more "category", which provides a decent proxy for genre. It's therefore possible to see how many words the shop tends to write about a record, depending on the category it's listed under. 

```{r hj-cat-counts}
# summarise word counts
hj_review_word_counts <- review_words %>% 
  filter(store == "Honest Jons") %>% 
  group_by(category, id, artist, release, label) %>% 
  summarise(word_count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()

# viz word count distro
ggplot(hj_review_word_counts, aes(x = fct_reorder(category, -word_count), y = word_count)) + 
  geom_sina(alpha = 0.5, colour = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7], size = 0.6) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme_ewen_rs(plot_title_size = 14, subtitle_size = 12, base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)) +
  labs(title = "Honest Jons' Jazz reviews are the longest (& Reggae shortest)",
       subtitle = "The word counts of Honest Jons reviews, by site category. Ordered\n(descending, left to right) by median review length.",
       x = NULL, y = "Word count", caption = "@ewen_")
```

There's not much in it, but reviews in the *Jazz* category tend to be longer than others. *Reggae* and *Dance* records are usually quite diddy.

Much like weighted log odds were used previously to understand store-to-store review differences, a similar approach can educate on review word uniqueness across these categories.  

```{r hj-cat-odds, fig.height=11}
hj_word_counts <- review_words %>%
  filter(store == "Honest Jons") %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  mutate(review_count = n_distinct(id)) %>% 
  group_by(category, word) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            count_per_review = round(count / unique(review_count), digits = 3)) %>% 
  ungroup()

hj_log_odds <- hj_word_counts %>% 
  bind_log_odds(category, word, count)

# plot highest log odds x category
hj_log_odds %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, log_odds_weighted)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, log_odds_weighted)) +
  geom_point2(size = 3, colour = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7]) +
  facet_wrap(~ category, scales = "free", ncol = 2) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_ewen_rs(axis = FALSE, base_size = 12, strip_text_size = 14, 
                plot_title_size = 18, subtitle_size = 12, axis_title_just = "c") +
  # theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, family = "Work Sans ExtraLight")) +
  labs(title = "Honest Jons' category-specific review words",
       subtitle = "The words featured in reviews of records that are most specific to that\ncategory (as listed on the site).",
       x = NULL, y = "Log odds ratio, weighted by uninformative Dirichlet prior", caption = "@ewen_") 
```

Unsurprisingly, the actual category name heads up many of the category-specific words. The results are intuitive elsewhere, too - "Mississippi" high up on the *Blues* list, "Nashville" on the *Folk* one. 

Interestingly, *Reggae* has the highest absolute log odds, suggesting that words used in reggae reviews are more "uniquely reggae" than in other listed categories. Beyond the top ten, what does the whole picture look like?[^ggforce]

```{r reggae-cat-odds}
desc = '"Rhythm", "roots" and "dub" are commonly featured, but also Reggae-specific, review words.'

hj_log_odds %>% 
  dplyr::filter(category == "Reggae") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(count_per_review, log_odds_weighted)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, 
               color = "#222324", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = word), family = "Recursive Light", size = 3, seed = 3,
                  data = top_n(
                    dplyr::filter(hj_log_odds, category == "Reggae"), 25, count_per_review)
                  ) +
  geom_point2(colour = ghibli_palettes$KikiMedium[7], size = 3, alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_mark_ellipse(aes(filter = count_per_review > 0.1, description = desc),
                    label.fontsize = 9, label.family = "Recursive Light") +
  theme_ewen_rs(axis = FALSE, grid = "XY", plot_title_size = 16, subtitle_size = 12, 
                base_size = 12) +
  labs(title = "Honest Jons' Reggae specific / frequent review words",
       subtitle = "The frequency and specificity of words used in Honest Jons' reggae record\nreviews.",
       x = "Words per review", y = "Weighted log odds ratio", caption = "@ewen_") 
```

## Fin

That's all for now. As a reminder, the data is freely available to play with [here](https://github.com/ewenme/crates). Holla if you do anything with it `r emo::ji("pray")`

[^fullcode]: To keep the post concise and pretty for non-coders, I don't show the code. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/rbind/ewenme/blob/master/content/blog/2019-07-15-whats-in-a-hardwax-honest-jons-review.Rmd).
[^scraping]: At time of writing, both record store's permit the gathering of their site's listings data (in accordance with the respective `robots.txt`).
[^lo]: The weighted log odds statistics used here is of the variety described in a [Monroe, Colaresi, and Quinn (2008) paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpn018), applied using Julia Silge's really neat [tidylo R package](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidylo). Related, a lot of the text manipulation was made easier by ANOTHER of Julia's ventures, [tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).
[^ggforce]: Thomas Pedersen's [ggforce](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggforce) was instrumental in this, and other, visualisations expressed in the post.
