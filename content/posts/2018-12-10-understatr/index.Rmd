[understat](https://understat.com/) is a treasure trove of football statistics and advanced metrics. All of your ~~"old man yells at cloud" conjuring~~ household favourites are here. Democratized access to xG for casuals everywhere, so we can do unholy things like this.

While the site itself is easy to navigate and features nice off-the-shelf exploratory viz tools (Ã  la the above radar), many (myself included) can get a bit fidgety without access to all this stuff in a structured format for analysis.

So, I made a thing to grab understat data and tidy it up, so you can get on with the interesting stuff. Say `r emo::ji("wave")` to [understatr](https://github.com/ewenme/understatr), an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package that makes pulling xG numbers as easy as `r emo::ji("pie")`

```{r dortmund-data}
# load package
library(understatr)

# get dortmund playing squad data for this season
dortmund <- get_team_players_stats(team_name = "Borussia Dortmund", year = 2018)

dortmund
```

You can use this in conjunction with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to get from data to viz lighting-quick. 

```{r dortmund-plot, out.width="100%"}
library(tidyverse)
library(ewenthemes) # (a personal chart themes pkg)

dortmund %>% 
  # remove players w/ zero xG
  filter(xG > 0) %>% 
  # chart xG in desc order
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(player_name, xG), y = xG)) +
  # make it a bar chart
  geom_col() +
  # flip the bars
  coord_flip() +
  # add some labels (making sure to credit understat!)
  labs(title = "Expected goals contributions", subtitle = "Borussia Dortmund, 2018/19",
       x = NULL, caption = "source: understat.com | @ewen_") +
  # add my personal chart theme
  theme_ewen_rs(grid = "X", axis = FALSE, axis_text_size = 9)
```

Peep the project's GitHub page for updates, for now at least. As noted in the [readme](https://github.com/ewenme/understatr/blob/master/README.md), while non-commercial use of the data is fine for now, I don't own it and similarly don't control changes to the website. I say this to say that `understatr` may break (or become illegal) in future, so enjoy it while you can `r emo::ji("balloon")` I'd be psyched to hear about people using it, or even contributing to it. Esp. here for the hottest of hot take Messi radar trolls, please cite the proj in all of those.
