<p>To anyone paying attention over the last couple of years, some ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù football metrics (or expected goals, at least) seem to have successfully navigated the five stages of <del>grief</del> haranguing from the media charged with upholding the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of the game. Imagine peak Lawrenson and Hansen in this scene:</p>

<p>Back in August 2017, <a href="https://statsbomb.com/2017/08/xg-is-on-tv-now-what/">StatsBomb‚Äôs Ted Knutson predicted</a> that the relentless xG circus would:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an entire new generation of highly educated fans and coaches who view the game itself in a more knowledgeable light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/">Fantasy Premier League</a> (FPL) is the official fantasy football game of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League">Premier League</a>, with more than five million ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù (plus many thousands of passive aggressive workplace league rivalries) and counting. FPL managers, particularly those taking it seriously/semi-seriously, probably represent an early adopter population in Ted‚Äôs above prophecy - fans with a vested interest in gaining competitive advantage. It definitely shows‚Ä¶ <a href="http://fmlfpl.libsyn.com/ep-161-fireside-chat-with-michael-caley">Michael Caley chatting to the FML FPL podcast</a> recently, for one.</p>
<p>I think there‚Äôs some appetite around for this stuff. What‚Äôs also interesting to me is that, as an application of metrics like expected goals (xG), fantasy football player evaluation is a far simpler optimisation problem than the real thing. Especially for attacking players, FPL player evaluation is predominantly about <em>individual goal contributions</em> (goals and assists) because they result in <em>points</em> (three for an assist, while grabbing a goal equals four or five points for midfielders and forwards respectively). Other contributions to general play can be glossed over for the most part, even the ‚Äúpre-assist‚Äù, hence why the original FPL valuation for N‚ÄôGolo Kant√© (¬£5.0m) was so much lower than Sadio Man√©‚Äôs (¬£11m) in the current (2019/20) season.</p>
<p>Therefore, a useful FPL evaluation of attacking players could be made using metrics that quantify activity at the very sharp end of attacking moves, namely variations of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>xG:</strong> How many goals should a player have scored on average, given the shots they took?</li>
<li><strong>xA:</strong> How many assists should a player have provided on average, given the passes they made?</li>
</ul>
<p>These can subsequently be combined to form an <strong>expected goals contributions</strong> measure, and thus a shorthand for understanding which attacking FPL assets to consider. So, what‚Äôs the hold-up?</p>

<p>Turns out that getting at the data should be quite simple - I‚Äôve already authored a pair of R packages ready for the job.</p>
<p>Both can be installed from GitHub using another library, <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/remotes">remotes</a>:</p>

<p>There isn‚Äôt a common identifier for joining across datasets, so a bit of prep is required to help join the datasets (e.g.¬†standardising team/player names). Names are annoying, so I missed off some recoding of non-descript (read: little minutes) attacking players.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sorry.</p>
<p>Once that‚Äôs down, the data can be merged and the attackers with reasonable minutes (at least 900) isolated. At the same time, we can put together the metrics of interest discussed above.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs get some of these numbers on the board, already. I‚Äôll start with a simple scatter plot of xG90 vs xA90, and also mark out players‚Äô FPL positions (PS - the chart styles come courtesy of another personal pkg, <a href="https://github.com/ewenme/ewenthemes">ewenthemes</a>).</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-03-08-xPoints_files/figure-html/simple-xGA-1.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This is <em>starting</em> to look useful for an FPL manager. It‚Äôs possible to spot players who are regularly creating and getting goalscoring opportunities. A bit more work is needed to actually identify who the best picks are, based on these metrics.</p>

<div id="speaking-the-same-language-Ô∏è" class="section level2">
<h2>Speaking the same language üó®Ô∏è</h2>
<p>First, it‚Äôs probably more helpful to express these expected contributions in terms that are familiar to FPL managers, and take account of the different rewards based on player position. Remember, goals turn into different points for midfielders (5) and forwards (4). Expected assists can similarly be expressed as a rate of FPL points. How does the rate of attacking points scoring stack up?</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-03-08-xPoints_files/figure-html/xPoints-calc-1.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs easier to differentiate a Mo‚Äô and a Kun, for example. Still, crucial information has been left out thus far - <strong>player price</strong>. Each FPL player is attributed a cost in ¬£millions. By adjusting for this, players who represent the best value can be unearthed.</p>

<p>This was a fairly quick run-through of how advanced football metrics can be expressed in fantasy football terms, using some bits of kit I‚Äôve built and shared that I felt guilty about not using much. There are things I think could be explored to make this better:</p>
<ul>
<li>A linearly optimized fantasy team (h/t <a href="https://github.com/martineastwood/penalty/tree/master/fantasy_football_optimiser">Martin Eastwood</a>), but an expected points variant.</li>
<li>Predicting expected clean sheet rate
<ul>
<li>Clean sheets are v important in FPL. Modelling teams‚Äô expected clean sheet rate would allow for an expected points linear optimization for an entire squad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Account for penalties
<ul>
<li>The xG figures in here include penalties. Preferable would be non-penalty goals with pens captured differently.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
