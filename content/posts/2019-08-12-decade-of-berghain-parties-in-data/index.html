<p><a href="http://berghain.de/">Berghain</a> is (in)famous for many things. The strict no photography and door policies (which you can take on, VR-style, via <a href="https://berghaintrainer.com/">berghaintrainer</a>), for starters. It also puts on cool parties, sometimes…</p>

<p>What’s also cool is, Berghain’s site still hosts their programming history on the site. This goes all the way <a href="http://berghain.de/events/2009-12">back to 2009</a> (check Hudson Mohawke vs. Rustie on the WARP 20 night - I miss Rustie 🙍). Some really neat projects have taken advantage of this public archive, like Artiom Dashinsky’s <a href="http://dashinsky.com/berghain-statistics/">Numbers of Berghain</a> piece (which, in turn, makes use of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_OJHzKBwDFIK0YoLSX65g-jp_5djxx-9d4x1-LKUsw/edit#gid=1355724553">Olle Holmberg’s googlesheet collating 2009-2017 events</a>).</p>
<p>I managed to pull listings from December 2009 through to July 2019 (at time of writing), now hosted in <a href="https://github.com/ewenme/berghain">this aptly-named GitHub repo</a>. Here’s the kind of stories you can quickly get into with it.</p>
